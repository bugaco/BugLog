# 003.Vue lifecycle methods

直接[摘抄](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Vue_refs_focus_management#Vue_lifecycle_methods)了一段：

1. `beforeCreate()` — Runs before the instance of your component is created. Data and events are not yet available.
2. `created()` — Runs after your component is initialized but before the component is added to the VDOM. This is often where data fetching occurs.
3. `beforeMount()` — Runs after your template is compiled, but before your component is rendered to the actual DOM.
4. `mounted()` — Runs after your component is mounted to the DOM. Can access `refs`here.
5. `beforeUpdate()` — Runs whenever data in your component changes, but before the changes are rendered to the DOM.
6. `updated()` — Runs whenever data in your component has changed and after the changes are rendered to the DOM.
7. `beforeDestroy()` — Runs before a component is removed from the DOM.
8. `destroyed()` — Runs after a component has been removed from the DOM
9. `activated()` — Only used in components wrapped in a special `keep-alive` tag. Runs after the component is activated.
10. `deactivated()` — only used in components wrapped in a special `keep-alive` tag. Runs after the component is deactivated.
