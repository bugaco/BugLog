We noticed that your app may contain hidden features, functionality, or content.

Specifically, your app includes Tenpay (财付通) Payment, which provides access to external payment mechanisms and enables the purchase of content, services, or functionality by means other than the in-app purchase API.

The App Store ecosystem is built on trust and users should never be misled about the apps they download. Attempting to hide features, functionality, or content in your app may lead to removal from the Apple Developer Program.

Next Steps

- Review the Performance section of the App Store Review Guidelines.
- Ensure your app, as well as any third-party code and SDKs in your app, are compliant with all sections of the App Store Review Guidelines and the Apple Developer Program License Agreement.
- Revise or remove any hidden features, functionality, or content in your app. 
- Once your app is fully compliant, resubmit for review.

The next submission of this app may require a longer review time, and this app will not be eligible for an expedited review until this issue is resolved. If we misunderstood the intended behavior of your app, please reply to this message in Resolution Center to provide information on how the app is intended to work.

前两天经过检查，发现处理h5微信支付时，用到了一个url，包含了“Tenpay”字段，用ascii转码处理后，重新提交了一版。

但是第二天还是被拒了。



今天在“解决方案中心”，向apple回复，请求确认一下，等待结果。

您好：

1.我们这边已经添加了“privacy policy URL ”相关的信息。

2.“Tenpay (财付通)”相关的内容，已经被我们移除了，烦请您再确认一下。如果是我们对此有什么误解，还望不吝指明。

Hello, 

Thank you for your reply. 

We continue to find that the app utilizes third-party payment mechanisms, such as Tenpay (财付通) Payments. To resolve this issue, it would be appropriate to remove all third-party payment mechanisms from the app. Alternatively, if you believe this mechanism to be used in a manner that is compliant, please reply to this message in Resolution Center to explain how this feature works.

Deliberate disregard of the App Store Review Guidelines and attempts to deceive users or undermine the review process are unacceptable and is a direct violation Section 3.2(f) of the Apple Developer Program License Agreement. Continuing to violate the Terms & Conditions of the Apple Developer Program will result in the termination of your account, as well as any related or linked accounts, and the removal of all your associated apps from the App Store.

We look forward to reviewing your resubmitted app.

Best regards,

App Store Review
