CocoaPods 1.8.x offers the ability to use either git or CDN. CDN is the default but for those who it doesn't work you can always fallback to the previous `git` based implementation by adding...

```
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
```

...to your `Podfile`.

This has been also mentioned in our announcement blog post.

Going to close this issue as I do not see any further action here.
