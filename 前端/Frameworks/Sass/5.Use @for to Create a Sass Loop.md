## from to:

```html
<style type='text/scss'>
@for $j from 1 to 6 {
    .text-#{$j} {font-size: 15px * $j}
}


</style>

<p class="text-1">Hello</p>
<p class="text-2">Hello</p>
<p class="text-3">Hello</p>
<p class="text-4">Hello</p>
<p class="text-5">Hello</p>
```

> `@for` is used in two ways: "start through end" or "start to end". The main difference is that the "start **to** end" *excludes* the end number as part of the count, and "start **through**end" *includes* the end number as part of the count.
