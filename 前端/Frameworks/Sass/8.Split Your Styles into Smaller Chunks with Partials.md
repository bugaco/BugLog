Partials in Sass are separate files that hold segments of CSS code. These are imported and used in other Sass files. This is a great way to group similar code into a module to keep it organized.

Names for partials start with the underscore (`_`) character, which tells Sass it is a small segment of CSS and not to convert it into a CSS file. Also, Sass files end with the `.scss`file extension. To bring the code in the partial into another Sass file, use the `@import`directive.

For example, if all your mixins are saved in a partial named "_mixins.scss", and they are needed in the "main.scss" file, this is how to use them in the main file:

```scss
// In the main.scss file

@import 'mixins'
```

Note that the underscore and file extension are not needed in the `import` statement - Sass understands it is a partial. Once a partial is imported into a file, all variables, mixins, and other code are available to use.

有一个文件“_variables.scss”，在“main.scss”文件中可以这样导入：

```css
<!-- The main.scss file -->
@import 'variables'
```
